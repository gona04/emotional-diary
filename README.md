# Emotional Diary

Emotional Diary is one of my most passionate projects, blending my background in arts with my enthusiasm for psychology and coding. This innovative app allows users to write daily diary entries, which are then analyzed to identify any cognitive distortions or thinking traps.

Currently, the app is a work in progress, as it is built upon an abstract and evolving concept. I am committed to continuously improving it and welcome any suggestions or feedback to enhance its functionality.

Thank you for your interest in Emotional Diary.

Possible features helping with CBT and DBT way of therapy.
